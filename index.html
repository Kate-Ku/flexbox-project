                <p>I was born and raised in Switzerland, but I have roots in the <span>Philippines</span>. When I got to know my relatives and the culture, I simply fell in love with the country.</p>

                <p><span>My passion</span> is surfing. I started when I was 19 years old and without having friends practising this sport I always felt that passion deep inside until I moved to my beautiful island home surrounded by amazing waves.</p>

                <p><span>Language connects!</span> I realized very quickly that language can build bridges between cultures. Therefore I'm trying to learn all the languages necessary to live and communicate with the people I live with.</p>
